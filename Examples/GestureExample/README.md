# GestureExample

The GestureExample project shows the simplest way to use the Bose GestureLibrary, and how it integrates into the Bose Wearable SDK.

The App simply connects to a Bose AR device using the Bose Wearable SDK, and it displays on screen gestures as they are recognized (if any), along with the confidence score (i.e. how likely it is that the gesture is actually that gesture).
